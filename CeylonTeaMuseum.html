                    The Ceylon Tea Museum at Hantane, three kilometres from Kandy city is served by a 
                    motorable road that circles the museum, 
                    provides easy access and adequate parking facilities for cars and tourist coaches.
                    The museum consists of four floors. 
                    The ground floor and the second floor exhibit very old items of machinery and the 
                    first floor consist of a library and an auditorium with 
                    facilities for audio visual presentations. The third floor is allocated to tea sales 
                    outlets, where a selection of Sri Lanka's fine tea is 
                    available. The entire top floor is a tea cafe. A panoramic view of the Kandy town surrounded by 
                    the beautiful Hunasgiriya, Knuckles Range and 
                    the Matale range of hills can be viewed through a telescope mounted on the fourth floor. 
                    The grounds surrounding the Tea Museum are landscaped
                    with different varieties of teas. Kandy is a mandatory stop virtually on every tourist's 
                    itinerary and the location of the Ceylon Tea Museum 
                    at Hantane enhances the attraction of the hill country to visitors. Additionally, its proximity 
                    to the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens and 
                    Loolecondera estate, 
                    where tea was first grown commercially in Sri Lanka makes Hantane the perfect location.<br>

                    <figcaption>  
                        <p>James Taylor, the pioneer of tea industry in Ceylon was born to Michael & Margaret Taylor at Moss park,
                            Monboddo Estate, Laurancekirk in Kincardineshiro, Scotland in 1835 (two years before Queen Victoria ascended the throne). <br>
                            Setting out from London on October 22, 1851 as a youth of 17 he arrived in Ceylon in 1852 and on arrival was sent 
                            to Loolcondera estate in Hewaheta a few miles distance from Kandy.
                            This was the period coffee had been grown on most plantations in the hill country. As the coffee plantation had been 
                            destroyed by a fungus, tea plantation took its place and became the alternative crop to grow. <br>
                            Taylor first started commercial planting of tea in 19 acres at Loolcondera Estate in 1867. <br> The seed he used had been
                            brought from Assam. As a result of his exhaustive pioneering efforts, in time to come the tea industry took deep roots 
                            in the economy of the island with James Taylor being acknowledged “The Father of Ceylon Tea Industry”.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
                The origin of Tea was with the Chinese Emperor ShenNung who was boiling water when the leaves from a nearby plant Camellia 
                sinensis plant floated into the pot. The emperor drank the mixture and declared it gave one "vigor of body, contentment of mind, 
                and determination of purpose." Perhaps as testament to the emperor's assessment, the potion of tea he unwittingly brewed that day, 
                today is second only to water in worldwide consumption!"
                Until the 1860’s the main crop produced on the island of Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, was coffee. But in 1869, the coffee-rust fungus, 
                Hemileiavastatrix, killed the majority of the coffee plants and estate owners had to diversify into other crops in order to avoid 
                total ruin. The owners of Loolecondera Estate had been interested in tea since the late 1850’s and in 1866, James Taylor, a 
                recently arrived Scot, was selected to be in charge of the first sowing of tea seeds in 1867, on 19 acres of land. Taylor had 
                acquired some basic knowledge of tea cultivation in North India and made some initial experiments in manufacture, using his 
                bungalow verandah as the factory and rolling the leaf by hand on tables. Firing of the oxidized leaf was carried out on clay 
                stoves over charcoal fires with the leaf on wire trays. His first teas were sold locally and were declared delicious. By 1872, 
                Taylor had a fully equipped factory, and, in 1873, his first quality teas were sold for a very good price at the London auction. 
                Through his dedication and determination, Taylor was largely responsible for the early success of the tea crop in Ceylon. Between 
                1873 and 1880, production rose from just 23 pounds to 81.3 tons, and by 1890, to 22,899.8 tons. The first vessel recorded as carrying 
                Ceylon tea to England was the steam-ship ‘Duke Argyll’ in 1877.
